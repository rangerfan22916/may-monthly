        <section>
            <p>
                The Toronto Maple Leafs are one of the National Hockey League’s Original Six teams and among the most
                historic franchises in all of professional sports. Since their founding in 1917, the Leafs have
                captured the hearts of hockey fans worldwide, winning 13 Stanley Cup championships—the second most in
                NHL history.
            </p>

            <h3 class="mt-4" style="color:#f9d342;">Early Years (1917–1930)</h3>
            <p>
                The team originally entered the league as the Toronto Arenas and quickly claimed their first Stanley Cup
                championship in 1918. After becoming the Toronto St. Patricks, the franchise was purchased by Conn
                Smythe
                in 1927, who renamed the team the Maple Leafs and established the iconic blue and white colors that
                remain
                today.
            </p>

            <h3 class="mt-4" style="color:#f9d342;">Building a Legacy (1930–1947)</h3>
            <p>
                Under Smythe’s leadership, the Leafs built a competitive team featuring stars like King Clancy and
                Charlie
                Conacher. The team won Stanley Cups in 1932, 1942, and again in 1945 and 1947, solidifying their
                position
                as a powerhouse in the NHL during the Original Six era.
            </p>

            <h3 class="mt-4" style="color:#f9d342;">Golden Era (1947–1967)</h3>
            <p>
                The Leafs enjoyed their greatest period of success in this era, winning six Stanley Cups in just 20
                years.
                Legendary players like Syl Apps, Ted Kennedy, Turk Broda, and Frank Mahovlich helped Toronto dominate
                the
                NHL. The famous "Punch Line" and "Kid Line" were key offensive forces. This era ended with the last Cup
                win in 1967 — a drought that still weighs on fans today.
            </p>

            <h3 class="mt-4" style="color:#f9d342;">Challenges and Changes (1967–1999)</h3>
            <p>
                Following the 1967 championship, the Maple Leafs entered a long period of ups and downs. Despite playoff
                appearances, the team struggled to reach the Finals again. Ownership changes and coaching shifts marked
                this era, including the arrival of players like Darryl Sittler and Borje Salming, who became fan
                favorites.
            </p>

            <h3 class="mt-4" style="color:#f9d342;">Modern Era and Rebuilding (2000–Present)</h3>
            <p>
                The 21st century brought renewed efforts to rebuild the team through drafting young stars like Auston
                Matthews,
                Mitch Marner, and William Nylander. Though the Stanley Cup has remained elusive, the franchise is
                focused on
                returning to its winning ways. New ownership and management have revitalized fan hopes for the near
                future.
            </p>

            <h3 class="mt-4" style="color:#f9d342;">Cultural Impact and Fanbase</h3>
            <p>
                Beyond the ice, the Maple Leafs are a cultural icon in Toronto and Canada. Their fanbase is known for
                its
                passion and loyalty, filling arenas and supporting the team through thick and thin. The Maple Leafs have
                inspired generations of hockey players and enthusiasts around the world.
            </p>
